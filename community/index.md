## Asking questions

If you need help with using FEniCS, or are encountering an error, you
can ask a question on the [FEniCS Discourse
site](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/). To make it more likely
that you get a useful reply to your question, you should:

- make sure that your post title and description make clear what you are
  trying to do,
- post a minimal code that reproduces any errors you are encountering,
- post in full any error messages you are seeing.
- include details of which FEniCS version you are using, and how you
  installed it (Docker, conda, pip, etc).

More advice on how to post a good question is
[here](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/t/read-before-posting-how-do-i-get-my-question-answered/21/4).

## Slack Channel

## Reporting bugs

If you encounter something you suspect is a bug, please [file an issue
for the appropriate FEniCS component on
GitHub](https://github.com/FEniCS). In particular, for reporting bugs in
the FEniCSx user interface, visit the [DOLFINx issues

but minimal code examples.

## Contributing

We encourage users to take active part in developing and documenting
FEniCSx. As an active developer, it is easy to influence the direction
and focus of the project. To contribute to FEniCSx development, engage
with other developers on the [FEniCSx Slack
