Get in touch with the FEniCS community, discuss your issues and share your knowledge with 
other users, and hook up with developers to contribute to the future development of FEniCS.

## Code of Conduct
We strive to make the FEniCS Project an open and respectful community. Our
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
sets out the expected standards of behaviour for the FEniCS community. It applies to all 
FEniCS activities including online forums and FEniCS workshops.

## Slack Channel
Most discussions about FEniCS and its development take place on the
[FEniCS Slack channels](https://fenicsproject.slack.com/). 
Everyone is invited to read and take part in discussions. You can join our Slack community by 
[entering your email address here](https://fenicsproject-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

## Asking questions
If you need help with using FEniCS, or are encountering an error, you can ask a question in the
[FEniCS Discourse site](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/). In order to make it more likely that you get a useful reply
to your question, you should:

- make sure that your post title and description make it clear what you are trying to do,
- post a minimal code that reproduces any errors you are encountering
- post in full any error messages you are seeing
- include details of which FEniCS version you are using, and how you installed it (Docker/conda/pip/etc)

You can find more advice about how to post a good question (and examples)
[here](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/t/read-before-posting-how-do-i-get-my-question-answered/21/4).

## Reporting bugs
If you encounter something you suspect is a bug, please
[file an issue for the appropriate FEniCS component on GitHub](https://github.com/FEniCS).
In particular, for reporting bugs in the FEniCSx user interface, 
visit the [DOLFINx issues page](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/issues).
As above, post complete but minimal code examples.

## Contributing
We encourage users to take active part in developing and documenting FEniCSx. As an active 
developer, it is easy to influence the direction and focus of the project. To contribute to 
FEniCSx development, engage with other developers on the
[FEniCSx Slack channels](https://fenicsproject.slack.com/): in particular, you should join the **#fenicsx** and **#development**
channels.

The [FEniCSx source code](https://github.com/FEniCS) is hosted on GitHub. Signed copyright consents are needed for non-trivial
contributions. The copyright policy and the consent submission procedures are described in
[the governance documents](https://github.com/FEniCS/governance/blob/master/project-license.md).
