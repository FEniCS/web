The FEniCS Project has always adopted the philosophy of open source development. It is 
important to us that anyone may access and contribute. The [community](https://fenicsproject.org/community/)
surrounding the FEniCS Project hosts a wide variety of users: academics, scientists, engineers, hobbyists, students 
and many more. We encourage anyone and everyone to take part, for example:
in the [Discourse group](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/),
on our [Slack channel](https://fenicsproject.slack.com/),
contributing to the [source code](https://github.com/FEniCS) or joining us at one of the 
[conferences](https://fenicsproject.org/fenics-2021/).

The distinctiveness of all our backgrounds, combined with our individual ambitions, drives 
innovation in the FEniCS Project. Drawing from this inspiration, here we meet some of the 
members of the eclectic FEniCS community.
