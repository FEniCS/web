The FEniCS Project has always adopted the philosophy of open source development. It is 
important to us that anyone may access and contribute. The [community](https://fenicsproject.org/community/)
surrounding the FEniCS Project hosts a wide variety of users: academics, scientists, engineers, hobbyists, students 
and many more. We encourage anyone and everyone to take part, for example:
in the [Discourse group](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/),
on our [Slack channel](https://fenicsproject.slack.com/),
contributing to the [source code](https://github.com/FEniCS) or joining us at one of the 
[conferences](https://fenicsproject.org/fenics-2021/).

The distinctiveness of all our backgrounds, combined with our individual ambitions, drives 
innovation in the FEniCS Project. Drawing from this inspiration, here we meet some of the 
members of the eclectic FEniCS community.

I grew up mostly in Texas, but my father worked in the oil industry, so we also lived in Indonesia and England, plus a 
semester of my undergraduate engineering program I studied in Mexico. Mechanical Engineering, especially design, is my first 
career, and I am licensed to practice in Texas. I am also certified to teach Engineering in Texas public schools. Now I have 
returned to school for my PhD in order to equip the next generation of engineers to solve 21st century problems by teaching at 
the university level.

For part of my dissertation, I will need to solve partial differential equation problems with finite-element methods for the 
design of theoretical materials, and this led me to FEniCS. I have used various technologies and programs as tools for my 
entire professional life, so this has been a fun challenge to learn FEniCS, Python, and Linux all at the same time! I 
appreciate how FEniCS allows a math-based “front-end” for problem set-up, and it just takes care of the rest of the solution, 
so that you can move your project ahead with the results (let’s call this the Engineering approach). Yet, if you need more 
than what is available, it is flexible enough to allow “back-end” improvements and modifications to develop new methods, 
modules, functions, and code so that FEniCS becomes more useful for everyone (let’s call this the Research approach).

My major interests in the discourse are Documentation, Tutorial files, and Installation, adding the “why”-type comments that a 
good teacher naturally wants to provide. I look forward to finding more uses for FEniCS and to furthering the discourse to 
help anyone interested in Engineering or Research approaches with this Finite Element Computational Software (the “ni” nicely 
transforms what could have been another boring acronym into a phonetic spelling for the mascot of the originator’s university...
a bonus for pun-loving geeks like me!).

I had no idea what I wanted to be in my youth. And I don’t think I can give an honest account of how I got here. At some point 
I just realised that a lot of the things I was interested in had deep explanations rooted in physics. When I got to university 
I decided to try some things that would be new to me, including Psychology—big mistake. I became interested in Earth Science, 
but even then I was drawn to the sub-field of Earth Science that most resembles physics.

Now I’m what’s called a “computational geodynamicist”. More importantly, I am trying to solve the puzzle of how our planet got 
to its present state. And over the past 2 years I’ve been using FEniCS to simulate its evolution. These kinds of models help 
us probe the Earth’s distant past and deep interior, giving us the ability to test hypotheses where physical experiments 
remain intractable.

Being a user of multiple computing platforms, I find reading and writing math in FEniCS to be silky smooth by comparison. I 
know, I know, everyone loves the ease of defining variational forms in FEniCS. But coming to scientific computing with a 
physical science background, I always feel like I’m staring down hurdles that I’m not quite tall enough to clear. FEniCS 
immediately removed some of them for me.

I hope to make it to more FEniCS conferences in the future. The community is fantastic, very friendly, deeply interested in 
science and unusually open to collaboration with outsiders.
