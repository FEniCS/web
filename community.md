## Code of Conduct
We strive to make the FEniCS Project an open and respectful community. Our
[Code of Conduct]({{ site.webroot }}code-of-conduct.md)
sets out the expected standards of behaviour for the FEniCS community. It applies to all 
FEniCS activities including online forums and FEniCS workshops.

## Slack Channel
Most discussions about FEniCS and its development take place on the
[FEniCS Slack channels](https://fenicsproject.slack.com/). 
Everyone is invited to read and take part in discussions. You can join our Slack community by

## Asking questions
If you need help with using FEniCS, ask your question in the
[FEniCS Discourse site](https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/).
If you have a specific question related to obtaining, building or installing a FEniCS component,
please send a message to the [FEniCS support mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fenics-support).

## Contributing
We encourage users to take active part in developing and documenting FEniCS. As an active 
developer, it is easy to influence the direction and focus of the project. To contribute to 
FEniCS development, engage with other developers on the

contributions. The copyright policy and the consent submission procedures are described in
