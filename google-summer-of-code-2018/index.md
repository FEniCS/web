The FEniCS Project participated in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/?target=_blank) through our fiscal sponsorship agreement with [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/programs/google-summer-of-code/?target=_blank).

You can read the final reports of [Fabian LÃ¶schner](https://gist.github.com/w1th0utnam3/6ca59f112572dc166048be78d9e631c5/?target=_blank) (improving the performance of generated finite element kernels) and [Igor Baratta](https://gist.github.com/IgorBaratta/c7ca5252834f2c70efe0d233a3acecb4/?target=_blank) (complex number support in FEniCS).

You can see how [Igor](https://igorbaratta.github.io/gsoc_blog/?target=_blank) and [Fabian](https://w1th0utnam3.github.io/gsoc18/?target=_blank) got on through the summer on their blog pages, and on our [Slack channels](https://fenicsproject-slack-invite.herokuapp.com) #complex and #simd.
