## The FEniCS computing platform

FEniCS is a popular open-source computing platform for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) with the finite element method (FEM). FEniCS enables users to quickly
translate scientific models into efficient finite element code. With the
high-level Python and C++ interfaces to FEniCS, it is easy to get
started, but FEniCS offers also powerful capabilities for more
experienced programmers. FEniCS runs on a multitude of platforms
ranging from laptops to high-performance computers.
