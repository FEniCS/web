## The FEniCS computing platform

FEniCS is a popular open-source 
([LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)) computing 
platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). FEniCS 
enables users to quickly translate scientific models into efficient 
finite element code. With the high-level Python and C++ interfaces to 
FEniCS, it is easy to get started, but FEniCS offers also powerful 
capabilities for more experienced programmers. FEniCS runs on a 
multitude of platforms ranging from laptops to high-performance 
clusters.
