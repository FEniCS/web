# The FEniCS Book

![The FEniCS Book](/assets/img/docs/book.png){: .image-right } The book
*Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element
Method* explains the theoretical background and design of FEniCS. It
describes the FEniCS software components in detail and showcases a
number of applications of FEniCS to problems in fluid mechanics, solid
mechanics, electromagnetics, and geophysics. The book was published in
2012, and was based on the legacy FEniCS library, so the code examples
in the book are out of date. However, the book still gives a good
description of the many of the concepts in FEniCSx.

The book is available as a [free
ebook](http://launchpad.net/fenics-book/trunk/final/+download/fenics-book-2011-10-27-final.pdf),
or can be bought from
[Springer](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1)
or many other bookshops.
