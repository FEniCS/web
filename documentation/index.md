# The FEniCS book

The book [Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite
Element Method](book.md) explains the theoretical background and design
of FEniCS. It describes the FEniCS software components in detail and
showcases a number of applications of FEniCS to problems in fluid
mechanics, solid mechanics, electromagnetics, and geophysics. The book
was published in 2012, and was based on the legacy FEniCS library, so
the code examples in the book are out of date. However, the book still
gives a good description of the many of the design principles that
FEniCSx is based on.

The book is available as a [free
ebook](http://launchpad.net/fenics-book/trunk/final/+download/fenics-book-2011-10-27-final.pdf),
or can be bought from
[Springer](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1)
or many other bookshops.
