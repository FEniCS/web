## Getting started

If you're new to FEniCS, we suggest starting with the [DOLFINx Python demos](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/v{{site.dolfinxversion}}/python/demos.html),
or [the FEniCSx tutorial](https://jorgensd.github.io/dolfinx-tutorial/).

If you have questions about how to use FEniCS, you can find links to how to do this on the [community page](../community/index.md).

## Documentation

Full documentation of the components of FEniCSx is available at
[https://docs.fenicsproject.org/](https://docs.fenicsproject.org/).

[The FEniCSx tutorial](https://jorgensd.github.io/dolfinx-tutorial/)
provides a range of tutorial programs as Jupyter notebooks.

### Release notes

- [Release notes: v0.9.0](./v0_9_0.md)

## FEniCSx vs legacy FEniCS

FEniCSx is the latest iteration of FEniCS, and boasts a number of
major improvements over the legacy library.
We recommend that new users use the latest release of FEniCSx.
The FEniCSx [development roadmap](roadmap.md) summarises planned
features.

Documentation for the legacy version of FEniCS is available at
[https://fenicsproject.org/olddocs/](https://fenicsproject.org/olddocs/).

## The FEniCS Book

![The FEniCS Book](/assets/img/docs/book.png){: .image-right } The book
_Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element
Method_ explains the theoretical background and design of FEniCS. It
describes the FEniCS software components in detail and showcases a
number of applications of FEniCS to problems in fluid mechanics, solid
mechanics, electromagnetics, and geophysics. The book was published in
2012, and was based on the legacy FEniCS library, so the code examples
in the book are out of date. However, the book still gives a good
description of many of the concepts in FEniCSx.

The book is available as a [free
ebook](http://launchpad.net/fenics-book/trunk/final/+download/fenics-book-2011-10-27-final.pdf),
or can be bought from
[Springer](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-23098-1)
or many other bookshops.
