The FEniCS Book is written by researchers and developers behind the FEniCS Project and 
explores an advanced, expressive approach to the development of mathematical software. The 
presentation spans mathematical background, software design, and the use of FEniCS in 
applications. Theoretical aspects are complemented with computer code.

The first part of the book explains the mathematical methodology behind the FEniCS Project, 
the second part gives an overview of the design of the FEniCS software suite, and the third 
part presents applications of FEniCS to a wide range of problems, including fluid flow, solid 
mechanics, electromagnetics, and geophysics.

The FEniCS Book was first published in 2012 with Springer. The popular opening tutorial 
chapter of the FEniCS book has recently been expanded, revised, and updated to cover the 
latest developments in FEniCS. Visit the
[FEniCS Tutorial web page](../documentation/tutorial.md)
to access the new tutorial.
