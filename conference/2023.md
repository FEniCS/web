We will offer travel awards for attendees who would otherwise struggle to come to the conference
for financial reasons, e.g. junior students and researchers or those working
in countries with a less developed research infrastructure. Applicants to the 
travel award are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract to the conference.

To apply for a travel award, send a letter of motivation, an estimation of
travel costs, CV and the conference abstract (if applicable) to 
[Francesco Ballarin](mailto:francesco.ballarin@unicatt.it). 
Applications will be assessed by the organizing committee, and all applicants will be notified
if their request has been accepted. 
The cut-off date for applications will be announced in early 2023.
