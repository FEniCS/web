We welcome developers, existing and potential users of the
FEniCS ecosystem as well as mathematicians, computer scientists and
application domain specialists interested in numerical methods, their
implementation and applications.

The FEniCS 2023 conference will emphasize an open and inclusive

## Registration and accommodation

All participants must register for the conference. Registration to the conference and hotel booking are two separate processes, but we suggest to carry them out at the same time.
- The conference has been organised with on site accommodation in mind.
[Hotel Flamingo Resort \*\*\*\*](https://www.hotelflamingosardinia.com/) offers full board accomodation: to book their room, participants have to compile [this form](/assets/extra/fenics2023/hotel-booking-form.docx) and send it directly to the hotel. The conference group rate expired on March 31, 2023, but there may still be a few rooms available: participants are encouraged to get in touch with the hotel manager (see form above for the email address) as soon as possible to inquire on room and conference group rate availability.
- The conference registration fee is 150 €. ~~The early bird conference registration fee was 125 € and expired on March 31, 2023~~. Participants have to compile [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIr8tgzs0Hm9LEyxpha6SwujJw1jRU1ek15uBzY-IfJf7nVw/viewform) to register. The form includes instructions on how to send the payment, either by bank transfer or on eventbrite. The registration fee is processed by our academic partner network [CSGI, Consorzio per lo Sviluppo dei Sistemi a Grande Interfase](https://www.csgi.unifi.it/).

## Abstract submission

[Call for abstracts](https://forms.gle/h87NAnQ9hi9pp4PP7) is now open.
Titles and abstracts for talk have to be proposed up to May 14, 2023, but registration (with hotel booking) is strongly recommended by March 31, 2023 since hotel rooms are limited.
Conference delegates will be notified if their talk has been accepted. The length
of talks will depend on registration numbers, but is expected to be around 15
minutes (plus time for questions).
Talking is not a prerequisite for attending: you can register for the
conference and attend without talking.

## Travel awards

We will offer travel awards for attendees who would otherwise struggle to come to the conference
for financial reasons, e.g. junior students and researchers or those working
in countries with a less developed research infrastructure. Applicants to the
travel award are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract to the conference.

To apply for a travel award, send a letter of motivation, an estimation of
travel costs, CV and the conference abstract (if applicable) to
[Francesco Ballarin](mailto:francesco.ballarin@unicatt.it).
Applications will be assessed by the organizing committee, and all applicants will be notified
if their request has been accepted.
The cut-off date for applications will be announced in early 2023.

## Getting to Pula

The main option for traveling to Sardinia is to fly to the Cagliari Elmas Airport (CAG).
Further details on how to reach the conference venue in Pula will be posted in spring 2023.
