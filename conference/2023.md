## Registration and accommodation

All participants must register for the conference. Registration to the conference and hotel booking are two separate processes, but we suggest to carry them out at the same time.
- The early bird conference registration fee is 125 €, with deadline March 31, 2023. Afterwards, conference registration fee is 150 €. Forms for conference registration will be posted shortly.
- The conference has been organised with on site accommodation in mind.
[Hotel Flamingo Resort \*\*\*\*](https://www.hotelflamingosardinia.com/) offers full board accomodation at a special conference rate. Participant may compile [this form](/assets/extra/fenics2023/hotel-booking-form.docx) and send it directly to the hotel. The conference group rate is no longer guaranteed after March 31, 2023.

## Abstract submission

[Call for abstracts](https://forms.gle/h87NAnQ9hi9pp4PP7) is now open.
Titles and abstracts for talk may be proposed up to May 14, 2023, but registration (with hotel booking) is strongly recommended by March 31, 2023 since hotel rooms are limited.
Conference delegates will be notified if their talk has been accepted. The length
of talks will depend on registration numbers, but is expected to be around 15
minutes (plus time for questions).
Talking is not a prerequisite for attending: you can register for the
conference and attend without talking.

## Travel awards

We will offer travel awards for attendees who would otherwise struggle to come to the conference
for financial reasons, e.g. junior students and researchers or those working
in countries with a less developed research infrastructure. Applicants to the
travel award are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract to the conference.

To apply for a travel award, send a letter of motivation, an estimation of
travel costs, CV and the conference abstract (if applicable) to
[Francesco Ballarin](mailto:francesco.ballarin@unicatt.it).
Applications will be assessed by the organizing committee, and all applicants will be notified
if their request has been accepted.
The cut-off date for applications will be announced in early 2023.

## Getting to Pula

The main option for traveling to Sardinia is to fly to the Cagliari Elmas Airport (CAG).
Further details on how to reach the conference venue in Pula will be posted in spring 2023.
