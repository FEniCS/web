## Description

The FEniCS 2021 conference is an opportunity for all those interested in the FEniCS Project
and related projects to exchange ideas, communicate their results and network with the
automated scientific computing community.

Unlike previous FEniCS conferences, FEniCS 2021 will be held entirely online.

We welcome developers, existing and potential users of the FEniCS ecosystem as well as
mathematicians, computer scientists and application domain specialists interested in numerical
methods, their implementation and applications.

The FEniCS 2021 conference will emphasise an open and inclusive atmosphere, contributed talks
from a diverse range of scientific areas, and dedicated time for discussions and coding.

The talk schedule and abstracts can be viewed at [fenics2021.com](http://mscroggs.github.io/fenics2021)
