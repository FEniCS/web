## Getting there

If you arrive by airplane at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, there are trains to Groningen running every 30 minutes, either direct or with a change in Zwolle. Check the website [www.ns.nl](https://www.ns.nl/en) for the precise schedule once you land. If you are traveling by train from elsewhere in the Netherlands, check the same webpage for details. If you are coming from Germany by train, we strongly advise entering the Netherlands by train via Utrecht or Hengelo/Almelo, and then checking the train connections to Groningen.

In Groningen, public buses use a tap-in/tap-out system. You can simply tap your contactless
credit or debit card on the card reader when boarding and tap again when exiting.
The fare is automatically calculated and charged to their card—no need for tickets or local apps.
If required e.g. for reimbursement, the [OVpay app](https://www.ovpay.nl/en/app) can show a
detailed travel history. Trip details for a specific payment can also be retrieved without an app
or account on [zelfregelen.ovpay.nl/reisoverzicht](https://zelfregelen.ovpay.nl/reisoverzicht).

### Grading system for presentations

Judges will use a seven-point scale (0-7) to judge presentations on the following criterion:

#### Comprehension & Content

- The speaker provided clear background and significance to the research question.
- The speaker clearly described the research strategy/design and the results/findings of the research.
- The speaker clearly described the conclusions, outcomes and impact of the research, and was able to answer audience questions.

#### Engagement & Communication

- The oration was delivered clearly, and the language was appropriate for a non-specialist audience.
- The presentation slide deck was well-organized and enhanced the presentation.
- The presenter conveyed enthusiasm for their research, articulated thoughtful answers to questions, and captured and maintained the audience’s attention.

The score for each statement will be weighted equally into a final score. The final decision will be made jointly in the judges deliberation session taking the score and other comments into account.

### Grading system for posters

Judges will use a seven-point scale (0-7) to judge the the poster and its presentation during the session on the following criterion:

#### Comprehension & Content

- The poster provided clear background and significance to the research question.
- The poster clearly described the research strategy/design and the results/findings of the research.
- The poster clearly described the conclusions, outcomes and impact of the research, and the presenter was able to answer the questions of the judges.

#### Engagement & Communication

## Nate Sime's Award for Exceptional FEniCS Visualization

This award is intended to acknowledge the effort scientists place into the presentation of their work.

The winning image or video is judged to be most beautiful according to the committee's subjective sense of aesthetics.
Emphasis is given to the visual appeal of the image or video rather than the impact of the underlying science.
Ideally the winning image or video will summarise the complexity of the underlying science for the uninitiated scientist ("a picture tells a thousand words").

The image or video must be:
- Composed from data generated primarily by using the FEniCS project
- Relevant to the advancement of science
