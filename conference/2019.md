## Getting to Washington
The main options for travelling to Washington DC are:

- Fly to Reagan National Airport (DCA) and take the metro on the blue or yellow lines heading north.
- Fly to Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and take the silver line express from door 4 arrivals to Wiehle-Reston East metro station, then take the silver line metro east.
- Fly to Baltimore Washington Airport (BWI) and take the shuttle to the the BWI train station. Board the MARC or Amtrack train bound for Union Station. Descend into the metro for transportation around DC.

## Accommodation
Participants will need to book their own accommodation. Washington is a relatively compact city but check Google's walking/transit instructions before booking. We politely advise you book accommodation at least a few weeks in advance of the conference date.

### Nearby the DTM
Consider the Embassy Suites by Hilton and The Courtyard by Marriott Bethesda Chevy Chase. Both hotels are located in 
Friendship Village approximately a 30 minute walk from the venue at the DTM. Additionally these hotels are close to the Metro 
red line stop Friendship Heights for easy access to downtown in around 20 minutes.

provides an approximately 35 minute journey to the DTM.

with a less developed research infrastructure. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a poster or talk abstract to the 
conference.</p>

To apply for a travel award, send a letter of motivation, an estimation of travel costs, CV and if applicable, the conference

committee. The cut-off date for applications is March 15 2019.
