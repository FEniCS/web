## Travel awards

[NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org) have kindly offered to support travel
awards for attendees who would otherwise struggle to come to the conference
for financial reasons, e.g. junior students and researchers or those working
in countries with a less developed research infrastructure. Applicants are
strongly encouraged to submit an abstract to the conference.

To apply for a travel award, send a letter of motivation, an estimation of
travel costs, CV and if applicable, the conference abstract to [David
Kamensky](mailto:dmkamensky@eng.ucsd.edu). Applications will be assessed by
the local organizing committee. The cut-off date for applications is 8 July
2022.

## Conference venue

The conference will be held at UC San Diego, in the 2nd-floor conference
center of the [Structural and Materials Engineering (SME)
building](https://structures.ucsd.edu/about-us/directions).

## Conference dinner

The conference dinner will be from 5–7pm Tuesday 23 August 2022 on the
Structural and Materials Engineering patio. For more details refer to the
conference program.

## Getting to San Diego

The main option for traveling to San Diego is to fly to the San Diego
International Airport (SAN). You can use the city's trolley system
([Blue
Line](https://www.sdmts.com/inside-mts-current-projects/uc-san-diego-blue-line-trolley-extension))
to get to the UC San Diego campus area.

## Accommodation

Participants will need to book their own accommodation. Note that the
SME building is across the street from the UC San Diego Central Campus
station of the new [Mid-Coast Trolley Blue Line
Extension](https://www.sdmts.com/inside-mts-current-projects/uc-san-diego-blue-line-trolley-extension).
Attendees may consider lodging options near other trolley stations for
convenient access. We politely advise you book accommodation at least a
few weeks in advance of the conference date.

## Code of conduct

We expect all attendees of FEniCS 2022 to follow the FEniCS Project
[code of conduct](../community/code-of-conduct.md). Instances of
abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
