## Getting to Luxembourg
Luxembourg is served by Luxembourg Findel Airport (LUX) with regular
flights from many European destinations. Regular transfers to Luxembourg
Airport are available from European airports with international
connections, including London Heathrow (LHR), Paris Charles de Gaulle
(CDG) and Frankfurt (FRA).

Luxembourg can also be reached by direct high-speed rail connections
with Paris and Strasbourg, and standard rail connections from Cologne
and Brussels.

From Luxembourg airport you can travel to the centre of Luxembourg on
Bus 16 in around 20 minutes. Tickets must be purchased <em>prior</em> to
boarding bus 16 from the machine adjacent to the bus stop outside the
front of the terminal. For €2 you can travel on all public transport for
2 hours.

</iframe>

You can also take a taxi from Luxembourg airport to the centre in around
10 minutes. Typical prices are ~€30 on weekdays, rising to ~€60 on
Sundays.

## Accommodation
Please book your own accommodation. Once you have
[registered](https://goo.gl/forms/clalYUTLh5GW94TD3) we will send you a
list of hotels and discount codes we have arranged for the conference.
Luxembourg is a relatively compact city but its geography is quite
complex and hilly! Check Google’s walking/transit instructions before
booking. We politely advise you book accommodation at least a few months
in advance of the conference date. For guests on a budget, we highly
recommend the [Luxembourg Youth
Hostel](http://youthhostels.lu/en/youth-hostels/youth-hostel-luxembourg/)
that offers single private rooms from around €40 per night.

## If you have more time...
You might enjoy a [guided walking
tour](http://www.lcto.lu/en/place/tours/wenzel-circular-walk-regular-tours/)
through the [UNESCO-recognised old quarters and
fortifications](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/699/) of Luxembourg City
on the afternoon of 14 June. If there is sufficient demand, we can also
organise a [private walking
tour](http://www.lcto.lu/en/place/tours/wenzel-circular-walk-tours-for-groups/)
on the morning of 12 June. Please email
[mail+fenics@jackhale.co.uk](mailto:mail+fenics@jackhale.co.uk/) before
the 2 May 2017 if you are interested.

Other highlights of Luxembourg include [Vianden
Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vianden_Castle/) and the
UNESCO-recognised photograph exhibition [The Family of
Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_of_Man") at Clervaux
Castle in northern Luxembourg. For further tourist information, please
see [Visit Luxembourg](http://www.visitluxembourg.com/en/).

## Travel awards (closed)
The travel awards are designed to encourage current users of FEniCS to
become regular contributors or core developers. At the conference we
will organise a special session to allow attendees to meet the core
developers and ask any questions about the code base. Applications are
welcome from all, but priority will be given to those who would
otherwise struggle to come to the conference for financial reasons, e.g.
junior students and researchers or those working in countries with a
less developed research infrastructure. Applicants are strongly
encouraged to submit a poster or talk abstract to the conference as
well.

Applications for travel awards are to be sent to
[fenics-steering-council@googlegroups.com](mailto:fenics-steering-council@googlegroups.com).
Please send: a short CV as a PDF attachment, and an itemised estimate of
costs to attend the conference. We require a half page description of
the specific activities that you will contribute to the FEniCS Project.
We interpret contributions very broadly; activities could include
[answering Q&amp;A threads](https://fenicsproject/qa), squashing a few
bugs on the
[bugtracker](https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin/issues?status=new&amp;status=open),
implementing a small new feature, or enhancing
[documentation](https://fenics.readthedocs.org) and the documented
[FEniCS
demos](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/dolfin/en/latest/demos.html).
Other ideas are most welcome. Please be ambitious but also realistic
with your ideas!

## Abstract submission (closed)
Talk and poster abstract submission opened on 11 January 2017 and closed
on 24 April 2017 via
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fenics17). Each
participant can submit one talk and/or one poster abstract for review. A
PDF version of the abstract must be submitted using the instructions
provided on Easychair.
