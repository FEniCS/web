## FEniCS on Docker

To use our prebuilt, high-performance
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) images, first install
[Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your
platform (Windows, Mac or Linux) and then run the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://get.fenicsproject.org | bash

To run the FEniCS Docker image, use the command `fenicsproject run`. For
more options and features, see `fenicsproject help`.

Alternatively, you can start a container with the following `docker`
command:

```bash
docker run -ti -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared -w /home/fenics/shared quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:current
```

## FEniCS on Anaconda
To use our prebuilt Anaconda Python packages (Linux and Mac only), first
[install Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install), then run
following commands in your terminal:

**Warning**: FEniCS Anaconda recipes are maintained by the community and
distributed binary packages do not have a full feature set yet,
especially regarding sparse direct solvers and input/output facilities.

**Update**. 2017.2.0 release on `conda-forge` features MUMPS direct
solver, but lacks SuperLU_dist and MPI-enabled HDF5.

## Building FEniCS from source
For installation in high performance computing clusters we recommend
always building from source. For detailed instructions, see the [FEniCS
Reference
Manual](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
