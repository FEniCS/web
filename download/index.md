## FEniCSx vs legacy FEniCS

FEniCSx is the latest iteration of FEniCS, and boasts a number of

including support for a wide range of cell types and elements, memory
parallelisation, and complex number support. FEniCSx is comprised of
the libraries UFL, Basix, FFCx and DOLFINx. The latest version of
FEniCSx ({{ site.fenicsxversion }}) was released in

We recommend that new users use the latest release of FEniCSx.


Updates are now very rarely made to the legacy FEniCS library. We recommend that users consider
using FEniCSx instead of the legacy library. Lecacy FEniCS is comprised
of the libraries UFL legacy, FIAT, FFC and DOLFIN. The latest version of legacy
FEniCS ({{ site.fenicsversion }}) was released in
{{ site.fenicsversiondate }}.

site.fenicsversion }}) can be found [here](archive.md).
