## Introduction

The FEniCS core libraries have undergone a major redevelopment to bring
new functionality, improved performance and better underpinning software
engineering. The FEniCS Project is now approximately 20 years old, and
over that time our understanding has developed and the available tools
have changed significantly. The latest developments of FEniCS follow
these principles:

- Compact, modular core designed to be extensible and to support custom
  additions
- Reduced public interface that could be kept more stable
- Proper namespacing
- Use of established standards and conventions wherever possible
  (design, packaging, testing, etc)
- Properly separated C++ and Python interfaces
- Simplified software engineering
- Distributed memory parallel design throughout
- Improved documentation
- Faster just-in-time compilation
- Support for modern Python JIT tools, e.g. [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)
- Simple implementation of fast user 'kernels' from Python
- Just one way to perform an operation wherever possible

## New core functionality

### Short-term
- Support for ADIOS2 I/O
- Implemention of PointSource
- Support wider range of FE types (e.g. serendipity)
- FunctionSpaces on facets

### Longer-term

- Heterogenous compute platforms
- Mixed geometry meshes (e.g. quads/triangles hex/prism/pyramid/tet)

## Development

Development is taking place on [GitHub](https://github.com/FEniCS) under
the [DOLFINx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx),
[Basix](https://github.com/FEniCS/basix),
[UFL](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl) and
[FFCx](https://github.com/FEniCS/ffcx) repositories. The first "alpha"
releases of DOLFINx, Basix and FFCx are now available, although some
features are still awaiting reimplementation. The DOLFIN, FFC, FIAT and
dijitso projects are now considered legacy.

## Releases

We have published an "alpha" release of FEniCSx (DOLFINx, FFCx, Basix,
UFL) as {{ site.fenicsxversion }} in {{ site.fenicsxversiondate }}. The
legacy FEniCS Project (DOLFIN, FFC, FIAT, UFL), is still available with
release number {{ site.fenicsversion }}.

# Future of previous FEniCS packages

We know that a number of users and developers are wondering about the
future of the FEniCS packages.

Going forward, we:

- encourage all developers to engage with the FEniCSx development;
- encourage users and developers to discuss potential features/bug fixes
  on the FEniCS Slack Channel before making a pull request to FEniCS
  2019.1.0 packages.
- will accept occasional high quality pull requests and bug fixes into
  the FEniCS 2019.1.0 components
